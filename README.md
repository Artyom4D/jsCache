jsCache
=======

jsCache is a javascript library that enables caching of javascript and css stylesheets using localStorage polyfill. This is especially useful when serving your website for mobile phones, which has limited HTTP caching available, but also speeds up your site in an ordinary webbrowser as it saves HTTP requests.
